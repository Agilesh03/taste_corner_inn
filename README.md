# taste_corner_inn
Taste Corner is a frontend web project built during my free time using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It focuses on creating a clean, responsive, and user-friendly interface while practicing layout design, styling, and basic interactivity. This project reflects my hands-on learning in frontend development.
